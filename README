Installing this vimrc manually
------------------------------

Although a vimrc is a very personal thing, you may use mine if you like it. To do so, please do the following:

1. Clone this repo:
git clone git://github.com/geneuro/.vim.git

or download the plain source only:
wget -qO - https://github.com/geneuro/.vim/tarball/master | tar -xzvf -

2. In ~/.vimrc add the following line:
source /path/to/.vim/vimrc

That's all.
